## 🎯 What is GaiaSenses?

GaiaSenses is a Next.js application centered on a map-first experience (route `map3`). Every visitor gets a composition tuned to the **real environmental conditions** of the location they are looking at.

| Mode | What it does | How to enter |
|---|---|---|
| 🗺️ **Map mode** | Interactive Mapbox globe + live weather panel + BLE sensor input + map audio patch | Default view |
| 🎬 **Player mode** | Fullscreen visual composition (p5.js) with matching audio | Select a composition, or let the climate auto-selection pick one (`?mode=player&composition=…`) |
| 🔁 **Auto mode** | Unattended tour across preset locations (installation/exhibition use) | Auto-mode toggle (`use-auto-mode.ts`, presets in `map-constants.ts`) |

There is no separate `/player` route — the player is a modal on top of the map, driven by URL query params.

## 📡 Live Data Sources

| Data | Source | Where in code | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🌡️ Temperature, wind, humidity, clouds, rain | **Open-Meteo** (`api.open-meteo.com`) | `components/getOpenMeteo.ts` | No API key required |
| 🔥 Fire spots | **NASA FIRMS** (VIIRS, global coverage) via AWS Lambda | `components/getData.ts` → `…/prod/fire` | 100 km radius query |
| ⚡ Lightning | **GOES-19 GLM** (netCDF from S3 `noaa-goes19`) via AWS Lambda | `components/getData.ts` → `…/prod/lightning` | 100 km radius query; Next.js cache `revalidate: 7200` |
| 📍 Place names | **OpenWeather** reverse geocoding | `components/getData.ts` | The only remaining OpenWeather usage |
| 🗄️ Session telemetry & push subscriptions | **Supabase** (`GaiaLogs`, `GaiaSubs` tables) | `components/supabase.ts`, `lib/notifications.js` | Anon client (browser) + service-role client (server) |

### Two rain data products (they are not the same)

Rain reaches the app from **Open-Meteo** — this is the `gaia.rain` channel a Pd patch receives (`lib/gaia-vocabulary.json`). The satellite backend also exposes a **second, distinct** rain product at `GET /prod/rain` — **GOES-19 RRQPE**, a satellite rainfall-rate estimate — that the site does **not** consume today. It is finer in both space and time, which is exactly its artistic value:

| | `/rain` — GOES-19 RRQPE | Open-Meteo (`gaia.rain`) |
|---|---|---|
| Meaning | instantaneous satellite rain **rate** (mm/h) | last-hour accumulated precipitation (mm) |
| **Spatial resolution** | ~2 km at nadir (coarser over southern Brazil) | ~11 km (global ICON model over Brazil; ~25 km if best_match picks GFS) |
| **Temporal resolution** | ~10 min (ABI full-disk scan, Mode 6) | hourly (`rain["1h"]`) |
| Wired to the app? | no | yes |

Resolutions are the documented nominal figures. Exposing the satellite product to Pd patches would add a `gaia.rain.sat` channel — see [Gaiasenses-web#134](https://github.com/GaiaSenses/Gaiasenses-web/issues/134) for the wiring.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | **≥ 18.17** (18/20/22 LTS all work) | Next.js 14 requirement |
| npm | ≥ 9 | `npm ci` uses the committed `package-lock.json` |
| Internet access | — | Live data (Open-Meteo, AWS, Mapbox tiles) is fetched at request time |
| Chromium-based browser | Chrome / Edge | **Web Bluetooth** (BLE sensor) only works in Chromium browsers |

No Docker, no local database, and no Pd patch compilation needed — the Pd4Web WASM bundles are pre-built and committed under `public/`.

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (~750 packages)
npm ci

# 2. Create .env.local in the repo root (see the Environment Variables section)

# 3. Start the dev server
npm run dev
# ▲ Next.js 14.x
# - Environments: .env.local   ← confirms your keys were loaded
# ✓ Ready

# 4. Open http://localhost:3000
```

Routes compile **on demand** — the first visit to `map3` takes noticeably longer than subsequent ones. The root URL redirects through the middleware:

```
/  →  /pt?lat=…&lng=…&mode=map  →  /pt/map3?lat=…&lng=…&mode=map&composition=…
```

`middleware.ts` injects `lat`/`lng` (request geolocation, with a São Paulo fallback in dev), sets the `userLocation` cookie, and the server picks a composition from the live climate data.

### 5. Click **Start** (required for audio) 🔊

Browsers only allow creating an `AudioContext` after a **user gesture**. The splash screen's Start button is that gesture — it initializes the Pure Data map patch (Pd4Web/WASM). Skipping it means visuals without sound.

### ✅ What you should see

- [ ] 3D Mapbox globe (requires a valid Mapbox token)
- [ ] Popup with the resolved city name and live data (temperature, humidity, wind, fire spots, lightning)
- [ ] `?composition=…` appended to the URL (climate-based auto-selection worked)
- [ ] A "Running Map sound …" status after clicking Start (audio patch active)

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` in the repository root (it is gitignored via `.env*.local` — **never commit real keys**):

```env
# --- Required for the core experience ---
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.your_mapbox_token       # no token = black screen, no globe
OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_key                      # reverse geocoding only (city names)

# --- Satellite backend (fire + lightning + rain) ---
SATELLITE_API_URL=https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod
SATELLITE_API_KEY=your_api_gateway_key                         # the backend refuses requests without it

# --- Recommended (session telemetry) ---
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# --- Only needed to test web-push notifications ---
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapid_public_key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_vapid_private_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key                # ⚠️ most sensitive key — bypasses RLS
CRON_SECRET=your_cron_secret                                   # unset = /api/notifications sends nothing
```

| Variable | Required? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` | ✅ Yes | Globe rendering (Mapbox GL) |
| `OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY` | ✅ Yes | Reverse geocoding (place names). Weather itself comes from Open-Meteo, key-free |
| `SATELLITE_API_URL` | ✅ Yes | Base URL of the `satellite-fetcher-aws` API Gateway, without a trailing slash. Server-side only — never `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`. There is no fallback: unset, fire, lightning and rain report as unavailable |
| `SATELLITE_API_KEY` | ✅ Yes | Sent as `x-api-key`. The backend refuses requests without it. Server-side only, for the same reason as the URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | 🟡 Recommended | Writes session telemetry to the `GaiaLogs` table |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` | ⚪ Push only | Web-push (VAPID) notifications |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | ⚪ Push only | Server-side access to `GaiaSubs` (used by the daily cron) |
| `CRON_SECRET` | ⚪ Push only | Vercel sends it as `Authorization: Bearer …` on cron invocations. `/api/notifications` fails closed without it — **unset, no notification is ever sent** |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PD_WS_URL` | ⚪ Optional | WebSocket endpoint for the `/gaiaball` sensor bench (default `ws://localhost:9001`) |

Read the API key with the AWS CLI authenticated on the project account:

```bash
aws apigateway get-api-key --api-key <id> --include-value --query value --output text
```

> 🔎 **Fire, lightning and rain now need a key.** The backend used to answer anyone who asked, with no throttle and no spending ceiling. It sits behind an API key, a 10 rps throttle and a 50,000 request monthly quota — see `satellite-fetcher-aws`.
> 🛡️ **The push sign-up is rate-limited at the edge, not in code.** The subscribe form is a server action hosted on the `map3` page, so it travels as `POST /<locale>/map3`. A Vercel WAF rule (dashboard → Firewall, not in this repo) limits POSTs to 10/min per IP and answers 429 beyond that — nothing IP-related is stored in our database.
> 🩺 **Is the satellite backend up?** `GET /api/health` answers per source: `200 {status:"ok"}` or `503 {status:"degraded"}` with `sources.fire` / `sources.lightning` detailed individually.
> 🧹 `MONGODB_URI` appears in older docs but is **not read by any code** — MongoDB is a leftover dependency. Do not bother setting it.

## 🎨 Composition Catalog

**Every animation is declared.** One lives in `compositions/<slug>/` as a sketch
beside a `composition.json`, and `components/compositions/compositions-info.tsx`
is 64 lines of accessors over a generated registry — it used to be 368 lines of
imports, union types and hand-maintained entries.

There is one name for each climate value, listed in
`lib/gaia-composition-attributes.json`. No aliases: the old catalogue carried
`windSpeed` in one entry and `windspeed` in another, and the second reached
nothing. A misspelling is now an error with a suggestion.

### ➕ Adding a new animation

```
compositions/minha-animacao/
├── sketch.tsx           ← o p5, recebendo as props que o manifesto pede
└── composition.json     ← identidade, dados, áudio
```

```jsonc
{
  "id": "minhaAnimacao",
  "label": "Minha Animação",
  "author": "Seu Nome",
  "license": "CC-BY-4.0",
  "attributes": ["temperature", "rain"],
  "audio": {
    "kind": "mp3",
    "rules": [
      { "when": { "rain": { "max": 0 } }, "file": "" },
      { "when": { "rain": { "below": 3 } }, "file": "leve.mp3" },
      { "file": "forte.mp3" }
    ]
  },
  "thumb": "minha-animacao.png"
}
```

1. `npm run compositions:validate` — checks the manifest, the attribute names
   and the audio ranges. A misspelling is an error with a suggestion, not a
   value silently stuck at zero.
2. `npm run compositions:codegen` — regenerates the registry.

That is the whole procedure. `attributes` is the declaration: it says which
climate values the sketch consumes, and `composition-runtime.tsx` fetches
exactly those, chooses the audio from the declared rule and mounts the sketch.
No wrapper is written, and no TypeScript is edited — the same shape the
`gaia.*` vocabulary gave patches.

`audio.kind` is `"mp3"` for files, `"patch"` when a Pure Data piece provides the
sound, or `"none"` for silence. An `mp3` rule is either a fixed `file` or a list
of `rules`, where **the first one that fits decides** — like a sequence of `if`.

Each rule's `when` holds conditions per attribute, combined with "and", so a
rule can depend on two values at once: `bonfire` chooses among four files from
how many fires there are *and* how many are within 50 km. The operators are
`min` (≥), `max` (≤), `below` (<) and `above` (>). An empty `file` is declared
silence, and the last rule omits `when` to catch everything else — the validator
warns when it does not, because that leaves a state of the world with no sound.

*(Optional)* add the key to the category arrays in `use-composition-queue.ts` so
the climate can select it, and a preset location in `map3/map-constants.ts` for
auto-mode. Selectors update on their own — `CompositionDropdown` iterates the
merged catalogue.

> 💡 Most compositions play pre-rendered **MP3/WAV** files (`public/audios/`, singleton player with crossfade in `my-player.tsx`). A few drive **Pd4Web patches**, and `airports` uses **Tone.js** (an implementation of Brian Eno's *Discrete Music*, 1975).

## 🔊 Audio Subsystem (Pd4Web)

Pure Data patches live as sources in `patches/<slug>/` and are compiled to
WebAssembly with [pd4web](https://charlesneimog.github.io/pd4web/) by
`npm run patches:build`. The output is split in two:

```
public/patches/<slug>/
├─ pd4web.js         ← Emscripten loader (sets window.Pd4WebModule)
├─ pd4web.data       ← the patch itself, abstractions and assets
└─ build-info.json   ← which runtime it needs, and how it was built

public/pd4web-runtime/<hash>/
└─ pd4web.wasm       ← libpd compiled, shared by every patch with identical code
```

The wasm is addressed by content hash and lives outside the patch folder on
purpose: patches that compile to the same binary share one 2 MB file instead of
carrying a copy each. `index.pd` is not shipped as a file either: the patch is
already inside `pd4web.data`, and `openPatch("index.pd")` reads it from the
in-memory filesystem, never from disk. `pd4web.threads.js` is dropped for a
different reason — it is byte-identical across bundles and served once from
`public/pd4webShared/`.

**Compile flags:** `--export-es6-module --nogui` (optionally `-m 64` for 64 MB of memory).
**Runtime requirement:** WASM threads need `SharedArrayBuffer`, which requires the **COOP/COEP headers** already configured in `next.config.js` — do not remove them.

### Lifecycle (`app/[locale]/map3/pd4web-context.tsx`)

`startPatch(patchId)` performs, in order:

1. Looks up the patch metadata in `pd4web-patches.ts` (accessors over the generated registry);
2. Dynamically imports `/<bundleFolder>/pd4web.js` (the Emscripten loader);
3. Fetches `/<bundleFolder>/pd4web.wasm`;
4. Initializes the patch via the `Pd4Web` class (`openPatch("index.pd")` + `init()`, which starts Web Audio);
5. Stores `activePatch` and the `pd4web` instance in the React context and inserts a fade GainNode between the worklet and the destination.

**One patch is active at a time** — `startPatch` rejects if another patch is running or a start/stop is in flight.

`stopPatch()` → applies a 0.5 s fade-out, closes the AudioContext and audio resources, clears the active-patch state.

### The `gaia.*` vocabulary — how a patch binds to the app

**The patch declares its own bindings, by using them.** A composer puts
`[r gaia.temp]` in their Pure Data patch and the temperature arrives. There is
no registration step, no TypeScript to edit, and no list of receiver names to
keep in sync on two sides.

`scripts/gen-patch-registry.mjs` scans the `.pd` files for objects in the
`gaia.` namespace and writes `pd4web-patches.generated.ts` from what it finds,
together with `patches/<slug>/patch.json`. **That file is generated — never
edit it by hand.**

The complete list of channels lives in
[`docs/musico/vocabulario.md`](docs/musico/vocabulario.md), which is also
generated, in Portuguese, and written for musicians rather than developers. It
is not repeated here on purpose: an earlier version of this README carried its
own copy of the binding names, and that copy is what went stale. A shape of it:

| Group | Examples |
|---|---|
| Globe | `gaia.lat`, `gaia.lon`, `gaia.speed` |
| Weather at the point the globe faces | `gaia.temp`, `gaia.humidity`, `gaia.clouds`, `gaia.rain`, `gaia.wind.speed`, `gaia.wind.deg`, `gaia.lightning`, `gaia.fire` |
| Bolota BLE sensor, only while connected | `gaia.acc.x/y/z`, `gaia.co2`, `gaia.sensors` |
| Patch → app | `[s gaia.out]` — send a list of two floats and the globe moves there |
| Animation events | `[r bolt]` (lightningBolts), `[r start]` / `[s paint]` (lluvia) |

Every patch in the repository is on the vocabulary. The manifest still resolves
the old names — `latitude`, `aceX`, `co2`, `input`, `output` — as aliases, so a
patch written before it arrived keeps working, but none is left that needs them.
A patch that a musician sends in with old names will run; standardising it is a
rename of the send and receive objects, nothing more.

A typo does **not** fail silently the way it used to. `npm run patches:validate`
reads the patch, and anything in the `gaia.` namespace that is not a real
channel is an error with a spelling suggestion — `gaia.temperatura` is reported
as a probable `gaia.temp`. A patch that listens to no channel and no animation
event is also flagged, since it is almost certainly a mistake.

`patch.json` carries what cannot be read from the patch itself: identity,
author, licence, when it may activate, and tuning.

```jsonc
{
  "id": "paraisoGaia43",
  "label": "Map sound 43",
  "author": { "name": "…" },
  "license": "CC-BY-4.0",
  "build": { "initialMemory": 64 },
  "activation": { "moments": ["map", "player"] },
  "tuning": { "pollMs": 64, "epsilon": 0.5, "accEpsilon": 0.05 }
}
```

`tuning` controls how often values are sent and how much they must change to be
sent again — values below the epsilon are not re-sent.

### App ⇄ Pd message contract

```text
App → Pd   gaia.sensors   (every pollMs, list):
           [gyroX gyroY gyroZ accX accY accZ co2]

Pd → App   gaia.out       (list):
           [latitude longitude]   → moves the globe target
```

The map patch is **part of the control loop**, not just an audio sink: with the
default mapping method (`pd`), the patch computes the globe's target position
from accelerometer data. Safety rule (implemented in `gaiasenses-map.tsx`): Pd
output only moves the globe while a sensor is connected (input mode ≠ mouse).
Without a sensor, the app sends the individual channels as floats instead.

Available Pd4Web methods: `sendBang`, `sendFloat`, `sendList`, `sendSymbol` and
listeners `onBangReceived`, `onFloatReceived`, `onListReceived`,
`onSymbolReceived`. Reference sketches: **lightningBolts** (sketch → patch),
**lluvia** (start bang + periodic events from patch → drawing).

> 🔎 **From the browser console**, `Pd4Web.sendFloat` talks straight to Pd, so it
> takes the receiver name **inside the patch**, not the canonical one. On a
> patch that still uses legacy names, `Pd4Web.sendFloat("latitude", -23.55)`
> works and `sendFloat("gaia.lat", …)` does not — the registry does that
> translation, and the console does not go through it. Only one patch runs at a
> time, so a channel belonging to another patch reaches nothing.

### Binding patterns

#### Pattern A — dedicated player patch
Patch runs only for one composition in player mode. **One step, in one file:**
declare `activation.moments: ["player"]` and
`activation.compositions: ["<compositionKey>"]` in `patches/<slug>/patch.json`,
then run `npm run patches:codegen`.

There is nothing to set on the composition side. An earlier version of this
document said to add a `patchId` to `compositions-info.tsx`; that field no
longer exists anywhere in the codebase — the pairing is derived from the patch
manifest alone, which is why a musician can pair a piece with an animation
without a developer.

*Runtime behavior:* when the composition is selected and player mode opens, `composition-dropdown.tsx` **stops the current map patch** (if active and `keepMapPatch` is false) and **starts the patch whose manifest names that composition**. `toggle-play-button.tsx` handles restoring/stopping patches when returning from the player to the map.

#### Pattern B — keep the map patch
Composition keeps the map's audio running: set `keepMapPatch: true` on the composition entry.

*Runtime behavior:* `gaiasenses-map.tsx` computes `hasSharedPd4WebPatch` from `keepMapPatch`, which allows the map patch to remain active while the player composition is displayed.

### ➕ Adding a patch (checklist)

Nothing here compiles or registers by hand — the scripts do both.

1. Put the sources in `patches/<slug>/`: `main.pd`, any `Libs/`, and a
   `patch.json` (copy a neighbour's and edit identity, licence and activation).
2. Use `gaia.*` channels inside the patch. That is the binding.
3. `npm run patches:validate` — checks the manifest, the channels and the
   spelling of anything in the `gaia.` namespace.
4. `npm run patches:build` — compiles with pd4web into `public/patches/<slug>/`
   and installs the wasm runtime under `public/pd4web-runtime/<hash>/`, shared
   between patches that compile to identical code.
5. `npm run patches:codegen` — regenerates the registry, the musician
   vocabulary and the issue template.
6. Start it from the map audio button and check I/O in the **patch log panel**
   (`pd4web-patch-log.tsx`).

`npm run patches:check` verifies the generated files are current, so a
forgotten step 5 fails in CI instead of shipping a registry that disagrees with
the patches.

## 🎛️ BLE Sensor Pipeline

| Layer | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Connection | `app/[locale]/map3/ble-control.tsx` | Web Bluetooth GATT: service `19b10000-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214`, sensor char `…0001` (notify), CO₂ char `…0003` (notify). JSON payloads: `{quat, euler, acc}` and `{co2:{ppm}}`. Auto-reconnect (5 × 1.5 s) |
| Orchestration | `app/[locale]/map3/use-ble-sensor.ts` | Routes packets to smoothing, handles calibration lifecycle and CO₂ side effects |
| Smoothing & motion | `app/[locale]/map3/use-sensor-smoothing.ts` | Baseline calibration (quaternion, Euler fallback), median + EMA filtering, 30 Hz `requestAnimationFrame` loop, state machine `calibrating → idle → moving → settling → stopped` |

**Mapping methods:** `pd` (default — the Pure Data patch computes the target), `quaternion`, `euler`, `basic`.

**CO₂ as a trigger:** hysteresis around **1200 ppm** — above the threshold a composition opens automatically; back below, it closes and returns to the map. A CO₂ ramp simulator (`useCo2Simulation`) lets you test without hardware, via the motion tuning panel.

**Auxiliary tooling:** live motion-tuning panel (`motion-tuning-panel.tsx`), patch I/O log panel, standalone WebSocket sensor relay (`npm run sensor:ws`, port 3001), and the `/gaiaball` route as a sensor test bench.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Black screen, no globe | Missing/invalid Mapbox token | Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` and **restart** the dev server (env is read at boot) |
| First page load takes ~30 s+ | On-demand route compilation | Normal on first visit; subsequent loads are fast |
| Visuals play but **no audio** | The Start button was skipped — browsers require a user gesture to create an `AudioContext` | Click **Start** / the sound button |
| No audio on Linux/WSL2 browsers | The browser has no audio backend (e.g., WSL distro missing `libpulse0`; `enumerateDevices()` returns 0 outputs) | Use the host OS browser at `localhost:3000`, **or** install the PulseAudio client library (`sudo apt install libpulse0`) and fully restart the browser |
| Console: `…run Pd4Web.init() from a click event!` | Audio init attempted without a real user gesture | Expected under automation; click manually |
| Patch starts but is silent | Data-driven patch with nothing arriving — several only sound when the globe moves | Rotate the globe, or send a value from the console: `Pd4Web.sendFloat("gaia.lat", -23.55)` |
| Patch does not load at all | The runtime the bundle asks for is missing | Check `build-info.json` against `public/pd4web-runtime/`, then `npm run patches:build` |
| Wrong patch stays active after switching compositions | Patch/composition wiring | Check `activation.compositions` in the patch manifest and `keepMapPatch` in the catalogue, then `composition-dropdown.tsx` and `toggle-play-button.tsx` |
| BLE sensor won't connect | Non-Chromium browser, or Bluetooth belongs to the host OS | Use Chrome/Edge; on WSL2 run the browser on Windows. Without hardware, use the CO₂ simulator |
| Popups say a source is unavailable | Satellite backend degraded, or `SATELLITE_API_URL`/`SATELLITE_API_KEY` unset | `GET /api/health` reports each source individually |
| Stale/weird build errors after switching branches | Next.js cache | `rm -rf .next` and restart |
| Port 3000 busy | Another process | `npx next dev -p 3001` |

## 📚 Reading Order for New Developers

If you have 10 minutes to understand a bug, open these in order:

1. `app/[locale]/map3/gaiasenses-map.tsx` — the orchestrator; everything passes through here
2. `components/getData.ts` — the entire external data layer in one file (including the AWS coupling)
3. `app/[locale]/map3/use-ble-sensor.ts` → `use-sensor-smoothing.ts` — sensor pipeline
4. `app/[locale]/map3/pd4web-context.tsx` → `pd4web-patches.ts` — audio lifecycle and the accessors over `pd4web-patches.generated.ts`
5. `components/compositions/compositions-info.tsx` — the catalog; then `use-composition-queue.ts` for auto-selection

This path covers almost all behavior coupling in `map3`.

## 🤝 Related Repositories

### [`satellite-fetcher-aws`](https://github.com/GaiaSenses/satellite-fetcher-aws) — ⚠️ production dependency

AWS CDK (TypeScript) project that provisions the satellite-data backend consumed by this app:

- **Lambda (Docker, Python 3.13, ARM64, 512 MB):** `GET /fire` (NASA FIRMS), `GET /lightning` (GOES-19 GLM from S3), `GET /rain` (GOES-19 RRQPE).
- **API Gateway** (`/prod` stage) — every route requires an API key, under a usage plan with a 10 rps throttle and a 50,000 request monthly quota. The base URL and the key come from `SATELLITE_API_URL` and `SATELLITE_API_KEY`; nothing about the endpoint is in source.
- Local testing: `docker build` + `docker run` (see that repo's README); requires a `FIRMS_MAP_KEY` (NASA FIRMS API key).
- Deploy: `npx cdk diff` → `npx cdk deploy`. The CDK uses the AWS SDK, which does **not** read the session `aws login` writes — bridge it with `eval "$(aws configure export-credentials --format env)"` first.

**History:** the fetcher originally ran on Railway (2023–2025) and was migrated to AWS Lambda in March 2025. Weather data was later moved off the fetcher to Open-Meteo. In August 2026 the whole backend was redeployed into the project's own AWS account — until then it ran in a personal account belonging to someone no longer on the project, which nobody on the team could log into, rotate a credential in, or answer a bill for.

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Tech Debt

- 🗺️ **The Mapbox token belongs to someone who left the project.** Every Mapbox token is a JWT with the owner in its payload, and the one in use decodes to a personal account. Nobody on the team can restrict it by URL, rotate it, or see its quota, and the globe goes down with that account. Opening a new Mapbox account requires a credit card, so this is a decision for the research team — see `docs/mapa-alternativas.md`, which has a working MapLibre spike and side-by-side screenshots.
- 📦 ~~Several declared dependencies have zero imports~~ — removed (HIG-01): `mongodb`, `joy-con-webhid`, `@mediapipe/tasks-vision`, `@xenova/transformers`, `react-webcam`, `react-h5-audio-player`, `react-three-map`, `react-geolocated`. Note that `tone` was **not** dead: `components/compositions/airports/discrete.tsx` loads it with a dynamic `await import("tone")`, which a plain import grep misses.
- 🗂️ `public/` carries ~191 MB, and `public/audios/` is 176 MB of it — 92% of the repository, with no owner and no plan. git-lfs does not fit the free quota and a CDN runs into the `require-corp` COEP header that Pd4Web needs.
- 🐘 Postgres is on `15.8.1.111`, which Supabase flags as having outstanding security patches. The free-plan upgrade path is Pause & Restore; it was run and the version did not move.
- 🧪 Test coverage is thin: 54 contract tests cover the data layer and the health endpoint (`tests/`, plain `node --test`); components, hooks and the audio pipeline are uncovered. Releases are tagged since [`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/GaiaSenses/Gaiasenses-web/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (2026-09-08).
